   abstract = {The notion of interpolation and extrapolation is fundamental in various fields from deep learning to function approximation. Interpolation occurs for a sample x whenever this sample falls inside or on the boundary of the given dataset's convex hull. Extrapolation occurs when x falls outside of that convex hull. One fundamental (mis)conception is that state-of-the-art algorithms work so well because of their ability to correctly interpolate training data. A second (mis)conception is that interpolation happens throughout tasks and datasets, in fact, many intuitions and theories rely on that assumption. We empirically and theoretically argue against those two points and demonstrate that on any high-dimensional (>100) dataset, interpolation almost surely never happens. Those results challenge the validity of our current interpolation/extrapolation definition as an indicator of generalization performances.},

   abstract = {The physics of the tokamak pedestal is still not fully understood, for example there is no fully predictive model for the pedestal height and width. However, the pedestal is key in determining the fusion power for a given scenario. If we can improve our understanding of reactor relevant pedestals we will improve our confidence in designing potential fusion power plants. Work has been carried out as part of a collaboration on reactor relevant pedestal physics.We report some of the results in detail here and review some of the wider work which will be reported in full elsewhere. First, we attempt to use a gyrokinetic-based calculation to eliminate the pedestal top density as a model input for Europed/EPED pedestal predictions.We assume power balance at the top of the pedestal, that is, the heat flux crossing the separatrix must be equal to the heat source at the top of the pedestal and investigate the consequences of this assumption. Unfortunately, the transport assumptions of the EPED model mean that this method does not discriminate between different pairs of density and temperature profiles for a given pressure profile. Second, we investigate the effects of non flux surface density on the bootstrap current. Third, type I ELMs will not be tolerable for a reactor relevant regime due to the damage that they are expected to cause to plasma facing components. In recent years various methods of running tokamak plasmas without large ELMs have been developed. These include small and no ELM regimes, the use of resonant magnetic perturbations and the use of vertical kicks. We discuss the quiescent H-mode here. Finally we give a summary and directions for future work EURATOM 2021.},

   abstract = {The EUROfusion JET-ILW pedestal database is described, with emphasis on three main issues. First, the technical aspects are introduced, including a description of the data selection, the datasets, the diagnostics used, the experimental and theoretical methods implemented and the main definitions. Second, the JET-ILW pedestal structure and stability are described. In particular, the work describes the links between the engineering parameters (power, gas and divertor configuration) and the disagreement with the peeling-ballooning (PB) model implemented with ideal magnetohydrodynamics equations. Specifically, the work clarifies why the JET-ILW pedestal tends to be far from the PB boundary at high gas and high power, showing that a universal threshold in power and gas cannot be found but that the relative shift (the distance between the position of the pedestal density and of the pedestal temperature) plays a key role. These links are then used to achieve an empirical explanation of the behavior of the JET-ILW pedestal pressure with gas, power and divertor configuration. Third, the pedestal database is used to revise the scaling law of the pedestal stored energy. The work shows a reasonable agreement with the earlier Cordey scaling in terms of plasma current and triangularity dependence, but highlights some differences in terms of power and isotope mass dependence.},

   abstract = {This article presents a selective survey of algorithms for the offline detection of multiple change points in multivariate time series. A general yet structuring methodological strategy is adopted to organize this vast body of work. More precisely, detection algorithms considered in this review are characterized by three elements: a cost function, a search method and a constraint on the number of changes. Each of those elements is described, reviewed and discussed separately. Implementations of the main algorithms described in this article are provided within a Python package called ruptures.},
