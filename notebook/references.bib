   abstract = {The notion of interpolation and extrapolation is fundamental in various fields from deep learning to function approximation. Interpolation occurs for a sample x whenever this sample falls inside or on the boundary of the given dataset's convex hull. Extrapolation occurs when x falls outside of that convex hull. One fundamental (mis)conception is that state-of-the-art algorithms work so well because of their ability to correctly interpolate training data. A second (mis)conception is that interpolation happens throughout tasks and datasets, in fact, many intuitions and theories rely on that assumption. We empirically and theoretically argue against those two points and demonstrate that on any high-dimensional (>100) dataset, interpolation almost surely never happens. Those results challenge the validity of our current interpolation/extrapolation definition as an indicator of generalization performances.},

David et al.-Advances in the steady-state hybrid regime in DIII-D-a fully non-inductive, Abstract Future fusion reactors require a safe, steady state divertor operation. The required detached operation is, in tokamaks with metal walls, usually achieved by seeding of impurities, such as nitrogen. With strong seeding levels, the dominant radiation is emitted from a small, poloidally localized volume inside the confined region, in the vicinity of the X-point. The location of the radiating volume is observed to vary relative to the X-point depending on seeding and power levels, i.e. depending on the degree of detachment. At the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak, the position of the radiator relative to the X-point can be controlled in real time by a modulation of the nitrogen puff level. At a certain height of the radiator above the X-point, an ELM-suppressed regime is observed with minimal reduction of confinement. While the control of the X-point radiator already allows operation in full detachment at a dissipated power fraction of around 95 %, which is required for a future reactor and was previously never achieved in a controlled way, such an ELM-suppressed regime additionally eliminates the challenge of the transient, intolerably high heat fluxes by ELMs. Both requirements are met in the presented regime while maintaining a high energy confinement at high density.},

@article{Pitts2019,
   abstract = {On the eve of component procurement, this paper discusses the present physics basis for the first ITER tungsten (W) divertor, beginning with a reminder of the key elements defining the overall design, and outlining relevant aspects of the Research Plan accompanying the new “staged approach” to ITER nuclear operations which fixes the overall divertor lifetime constraint. The principal focus is on the main design driver, steady state power fluxes in the DT phases, obtained from simulations using the 2-D SOLPS-4.3 and SOLPS-ITER plasma boundary codes, assuming the use of the low Z seeding impurities nitrogen (N) and neon (Ne). A new perspective on the simulation database is adopted, concentrating purely on the divertor physics aspects rather than on the core-edge integration, which has been studied extensively in the course of the divertor design evolution and is published elsewhere. Emphasis is placed on factors which may increase the peak steady state loads: divertor target shaping for component misalignment protection, the influence of fluid drifts, and the consequences of narrow scrape-off layer heat flux channels. All tend to push the divertor into an operating space at higher sub-divertor neutral pressure in order to remain at power flux densities acceptable for the target material. However, a revised criterion for the maximum tolerable loads based on avoidance of W recrystallization, sets an upper limit potentially ∼50% higher than the previously accepted value of ∼10 MW m−2, a consequence both of the choice of material and the finalized component design. Although the simulation database is currently restricted to the 2-D toroidally symmetric situation, considerable progress is now also being made using the EMC3-Eirene 3-D code suite for the assessment of power loading in the presence of magnetic perturbations for ELM control. Some new results for low input power corresponding to the early H-mode operation phases are reported, showing that even if realistic plasma screening is taken into account, significant asymmetric divertor heat fluxes may arise far from the unperturbed strike point. The issue of tolerable limits for transient heat pulses is an open and key question. A new scaling for ELM power deposition has shown that whilst there may be more latitude for operation at higher current without ELM control, the ultimate limit is likely to be set more by material fatigue under large numbers of sub-threshold melting events.},

   abstract = {The recently developed integrated model based on engineering parameters (IMEP) (Luda et al 2020 Nucl. Fusion 61 126048; Luda et al 2021 Nucl. Fusion 60 036023), so far validated on ASDEX Upgrade, has been tested on a database of 3 Alcator C-Mod and 55 JET-ILW ELMy (type I) H-mode stationary phases. The empirical pedestal transport model included in IMEP, consisting now of imposing a fixed value of R < ∇T e > /T e,top = −82.5, allows an accurate prediction of the pedestal top temperature (when the pedestal top density is fixed to the experimental measurements) across these three machines with different sizes, when the pedestal is peeling-ballooning (PB) limited. Cases far from the ideal PB boundary, corresponding to high edge Spitzer resistivity, are instead strongly overpredicted by IMEP. A comparison between the predictions of Europed and IMEP for a subset of JET-ILW cases shows that IMEP can more accurately reproduce the experimental pedestal width. This allows IMEP to better capture profile effects on the pedestal stability, and therefore to correctly describe the negative effect of fueling on the pedestal pressure for PB limited cases. A strong correlation between the separatrix density and the fueling rate has been identified for a subset of JET-ILW cases, when taking into account different divertor configurations. Overall, these promising results encourage further developments of integrated models to obtain reliable predictions of pedestal and global confinement using only engineering parameters for present and future machines. 5 Stroth et al (https://doi.org/10.1088/1741-4326/ac207f) for the ASDEX Upgrade Team 6 Labit et al for the EUROfusion MST1 Team 7 Mailloux et al (https://doi.},

   abstract = {Type I ELMy H-mode operation in JET with the ITER-like Be/W wall (JET-ILW) generally occurs at lower pedestal pressures compared to those with the full carbon wall (JET-C). The pedestal density is similar but the pedestal temperature where type I ELMs occur is reduced and below to the so-called critical type I-type III transition temperature reported in JET-C experiments. Furthermore, the confinement factor H 98(y,2) in type I ELMy H-mode baseline plasmas is generally lower in JET-ILW compared to JET-C at low power fractions P loss /P thr,08 < 2 (where P loss is (P in − dW /dt), and P thr,08 the L-H power threshold from Martin et al 2008 (J. Phys. Conf. Ser. 123 012033)). Higher power fractions have thus far not been achieved in the baseline plasmas. At P loss /P thr,08 > 2, the confinement in JET-ILW hybrid plasmas is similar to that in JET-C. A reduction in pedestal pressure is the main reason for the reduced confinement in JET-ILW baseline ELMy H-mode plasmas where typically H 98(y,2) = 0.8 is obtained, compared to H 98(y,2) = 1.0 in JET-C. In JET-ILW hybrid plasmas a similarly reduced pedestal pressure is compensated by an increased peaking of the core pressure profile resulting in H 98(y,2) 1.25. The pedestal stability has significantly changed in high triangularity baseline plasmas where the confinement loss is also most apparent. Applying the same stability analysis for JET-C and JET-ILW, the measured pedestal in JET-ILW is stable with respect to the calculated peeling-ballooning stability limit and the ELM collapse time has increased to 2 ms from typically 200 µs in JET-C. This indicates that changes in the pedestal stability may have contributed to the reduced pedestal confinement in JET-ILW plasmas. A comparison of EPED1 pedestal pressure prediction with JET-ILW experimental data in over 500 JET-C and JET-ILW baseline and hybrid plasmas shows a good agreement with 0.8 < (measured p ped)/(predicted p ped,EPED) < 1.2, but that the role of triangularity is generally weaker in the JET-ILW experimental data than in the model predictions.},

   abstract = {Integrated edge-localized-mode (ELM)-free or small ELM scenarios for the demonstration fusion power plant (DEMO) are investigated in ASDEX Upgrade using argon seeding for radiative power removal mainly in the pedestal region. An important aspect is the modification of the electron pressure in the pedestal by the additional radiative power losses. Full ELM suppression could be achieved in a no-ELM H-mode scenario featuring an edge electromagnetic quasicoherent mode up to a heating power of 5 MW, where argon radiation allowed the extension of the heating power operational space. At higher powers up to 12 MW (reaching the beta limit), ELMs of reduced size prevail and detachment is obtained by the argon seeding. Control of the position of a radiating zone localized inside the X-point was found to be favorable compared to the control of the separatrix power for low Psep/Pheat. Integration of pedestal cooling with Ar and ELM suppression by resonant magnetic perturbations (RMP) allowed an increase of the core radiation and a partial recovery of normalized confinement to H98 = 1. This favorable behavior is finally limited by the loss of the RMP density pump-out effect, followed by an ELM-free H-mode phase and re-occurrence of ELMs. For an active tailoring of the pedestal pressure profile, precise knowledge of the radiation profile is required. Modeling of the argon radiation profile with the STRAHL code showed good agreement with bolometry only if charge exchange of neutral deuterium with argon ions was taken into account, highlighting the importance of the neutral density in the pedestal region. In view of best integration of a no-ELM scenario with divertor detachment and high heating power, the divertor compression and enrichment of argon and neon were compared using dynamic gas puff experiments. Argon shows more than a factor of 3 higher divertor enrichment compared to neon, but the absolute values decrease with higher neutral deuterium pressure.},

   abstract = {The physics of the tokamak pedestal is still not fully understood, for example there is no fully predictive model for the pedestal height and width. However, the pedestal is key in determining the fusion power for a given scenario. If we can improve our understanding of reactor relevant pedestals we will improve our confidence in designing potential fusion power plants. Work has been carried out as part of a collaboration on reactor relevant pedestal physics.We report some of the results in detail here and review some of the wider work which will be reported in full elsewhere. First, we attempt to use a gyrokinetic-based calculation to eliminate the pedestal top density as a model input for Europed/EPED pedestal predictions.We assume power balance at the top of the pedestal, that is, the heat flux crossing the separatrix must be equal to the heat source at the top of the pedestal and investigate the consequences of this assumption. Unfortunately, the transport assumptions of the EPED model mean that this method does not discriminate between different pairs of density and temperature profiles for a given pressure profile. Second, we investigate the effects of non flux surface density on the bootstrap current. Third, type I ELMs will not be tolerable for a reactor relevant regime due to the damage that they are expected to cause to plasma facing components. In recent years various methods of running tokamak plasmas without large ELMs have been developed. These include small and no ELM regimes, the use of resonant magnetic perturbations and the use of vertical kicks. We discuss the quiescent H-mode here. Finally we give a summary and directions for future work EURATOM 2021.},

First, the technical aspects are introduced, including a description of the data selection, the datasets, the diagnostics used, the experimental and theoretical methods implemented and the main definitions. Second, the JET-ILW pedestal structure and stability are described. In particular, the work describes the links between the engineering parameters (power, gas and divertor configuration) and the disagreement with the peeling-ballooning (PB) model implemented with ideal magnetohydrodynamics equations. Specifically, the work clarifies why the JET-ILW pedestal tends to be far from the PB boundary at high gas and high power, showing that a universal threshold in power and gas cannot be found but that the relative shift (the distance between the position of the pedestal density and of the pedestal temperature) plays a key role. These links are then used to achieve an empirical explanation of the behavior of the JET-ILW pedestal pressure with gas, power and divertor configuration. Third, the pedestal database is used to revise the scaling law of the pedestal stored energy. The work shows a reasonable agreement with the earlier Cordey scaling in terms of plasma current and triangularity dependence, but highlights some differences in terms of power and isotope mass dependence.},
