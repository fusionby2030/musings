## Core-edge integration revolves around maintaining high pressure while respecting plasma facing components


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

High $p_e^{ped}$ is desired: 

1. Maximizing pressure $\equiv$ maximizing fusion output (see lawson criterion).
2. Stiff gradients in core ($\nabla p \sim 0$) beget need for pedestal.

But we need to maximize $p_e^{ped}$ _safely_, i.e., while respecting heat loads on PFC materials

## Achieving high $p_e^{ped}$ requires a balancing act of multiple competing processes, e.g., core

Instabilities lead to turbulence which drive heat and particle transport along field lines (from core to wall). \newline
Turbulence good for reducing core impurities but too much leads to bad confinement.

Current- and q-profile tailoring leads to increased/decreased turbulence.\newline 
We can 'see' turbulence from the high frequency (MHZ) oscillations of density gradient profiles via reflectometry.

The P-B stability boundary sets the pedestal height/width.

Hitting the boundary triggers an ELM crash. Goal would be to sit below the boundary.

The P-B stability boundary sets the pedestal height/width. \newline

- Ideal (plasma perfect conductor)
- Resistive (not) \newline

Both happen, but the one that limits the ped. is the 'leading order gradient maker'

One must choose whether to calculate ped. based on resistive or ideal MHD stability, there is no current 'interpolation'. \newline

## (intermezzo) Pedestal plasma behaviour could be represented topologically? e.g., cyclical crashing (circle), increasing/decreasing of magnitude of boundary (cylinder)

![](./figures/example_cylinder.png)

Experimental data above, but thinking of applying the Diffusion-VAEs to project latent space to surface of cylinder. 


## Achieving high $p_e^{ped}$ requires a balancing act of multiple competing processes, e.g., SOL, or how to not burn wall

As we get to reactor-scale devices, the width of the LCFS tube, $\lambda_q$, decreases unfavourably with plasma current @Eich2013. \newline 

Therefore, if and when an ELM hits, we need to be clever about ways to mitigate heat within such a narrow tube.

One way is to *detach* the plasma from the wall by making a 'cloud' of neutral impurities, e.g., Nitrogen/Neon, that are ionized by hot particles passing by, radiating the energy away.

We can 'control' the heat flux/radiation front via controlling the neutral pressure, i.e., how much impurities we are pumping.

## Other noteworthy influenes on the pedestal that were not mentioned

We can limit pedestal growth such that PB-boundary is never hit (ELM-free) via impurities @Kallenbach2020. \newline

ELM's can also be paced @Lang2004: 

- Literally kicking the plasma up and down at the frequency of the ELM.
- Throwing small pellets of ice at the the frequency of the ELM. \newline

ELMs are a pertubation of the magnetic flux surface, so we can apply 'error-correcting' perturbations back (RMPs) @Liang2007. \newline 

These are all promising, but a ultimately a combination of all will be needed for ITER/DEMO.\newline 

## In brief

- Pedestal is the everything bagel, in that everything influences it, and it is the key parameter for reactor.
- Ultimately, the pedestal growth is driven by MHD instablities, limited by core turbulence, followed by corrections/degredations from SOL conditions. 
- We can not have full on ELM's (hitting the MHD stability boundary) in reactors, but there exist some solutions to mitigate ELM's. \newline 

$\Rightarrow$ probably need a kitchen-sink appraoch to applying representation learning.
