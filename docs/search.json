Therefore, I want to investigate the properties of error in prediction for various models w.r.t the distance from the quiered point to the convex hull of the training set."

    "text": "To achieve fusion, we need to confine the plasma for sufficient time. Without instabillities, the majority of confinement comes from Coulomb collisions, but transport of particles and energy is generally not so simple, leading to anamolous transport mechanisms.\nIn a cylindrical plasma, the collisional transport of particles and energy boils down to a diffusion process. Particles collide with a characteristic rate time \\(\\tau_c\\). The collision allows the particles to ‘step’ accross magnetic field with a step length equal to their larmor radius, \\(\\rho\\). This yields us a diffusion coefficient, \\(\\mathcal{D} \\sim \\rho^2 / \\tau_c\\), of particles and energy diffusing radially outwards.\nFor a toroidal plasma with twisted helical field lines, this is not the case, which is why transport in toroidal plasma is refered to as neoclassical transport. An example of such a change in transport is banana transport."

    "text": "Bootstrap current\nFriction related to transport from particles in banana orbit (collisions between trapped and non-trapped particles) leads to a diffusion driven current, otherwise known as the bootstrap current. This is different than the conventional current from the central solenoid.\nThe current is brought on by the change in the \\(\\nabla_T \\vec{B} \\times \\vec{B}\\) component from LFS to HFS, as the \\(B_{pol}\\) is rotating around the outer plamsa, and \\(\\nabla \\vec{B}\\) constant pointing inwards from the drift. This corresponds to the following additional drifts:\n\nFor particles near the LFS, i.e., \\(r > R\\), we will get a drift (with charge dependence due to eq. Eq. 1)\n\nions: in the direction of the current\nelectrons: opposite direction of current\n\nFor particles near HFS:\n\nions: opposite direction of the current\nelectrons: opposite direction of current\n\n\nSince particles spend a longer time in the reflecting stage of the banana orbit (??), there is a resulting net drift in the direction of the current, as the trapped particlestransfer momentum to passing particles carrying the current.
